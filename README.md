## Introduction to Greenshot User Guide
This documentation serves as an introductory guide to using the Greenshot screenshotting software. The instructions will walk you through the basics, from taking screenshots, to editing and uploading them.

The topics covered in this guide: 
* capturing screenshots
* annotating your screenshots 
* obfuscating sensitive information
* using your screenshots in microsoft office and paint
* uploading you screenshots to Imgur


## How We Collaborated

Our team did an initial brainstorming process to think of useful tools and applications that we had recently used that we believed could benefit from a new user documentation guide. We utilized Discord as our primary means of communication and organization. We chose to utilize Google Docs and the Bjorn Markdown Add-On extension to collaboratively work on our pages together. 

We chose to split the pages up into separate parts for each member to work on, but did the majority of our work in group calls. We utilized GitHub to finalize and test our pages on the live server after reviewing in Bjorn Studio. 

## How We Created Our Guide

We began our process of writing this use guide by determining the core features that we wanted to address after determining the GreenShot application as our topic. We broke down the topics into separate pages and each completed our own screenshots and Markdown documentation. After finalizing our work in Google Docs we imported the code into GitHub to test the code live on the GitHub pages site.

We implemented the upside-down pyramid writing principal to ensure that our documentation was easy to read, and that each sentence starts off as informative as possible.

Markdown allowed us to create easy to read, well organized user documentation for the application and integrated Jekyl themes to use as a basis for our design. We modified our Jekyl theme and formatted the layout for our page.

The theme that was chosen is Just The Docs, a popular theme known for its minimalistic look with a bright background and easy to read text. We decided it was best to stick to the most simplistic design available given that our documentation is tailored towards new users.


## Challenges

Like any assignment, we encountered a few challenges throughout our work. There was a point where our Github Jekyll document broke, and so the build for the website was not updating to show committed changes. We were unable to determine the root of the issue and repair the build. So, we ported all our changes to a new repo, being careful not to break anything. It became evident that using a theme that someone else wrote could lead to mistakes in the code if one is not careful with what they change. This situation is in parallel with being careful not to break someone elseâ€™s software code. 

## Conclusion

Given the circumstances with the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a challenge to work in groups without the ability to meet in person. Our team made use of voice and video communications to help facilitate an environment that mimics a situation that we may encounter in the field of development. This was also the first time any of us had used Markdown so everything was new to all team members.

Writing documentation that is accessible to beginners is a challenge. Working in a group, however, made this challenge much more manageable. Some of us had never used Greenshot before, giving us insight into how beginners approach the software. One member in our group was proficient with Greenshot and was able to provide insight on more advanced features. Together, we were able to write this guide intended for beginners as well as experienced Greenshot users. 


Thank you for taking the time to read through our GreenShot user guide, we hope that you have gained valuable knowledge from our instructions.
