## Annotating in the Editor
The Greenshot editor can be used to annotate your photo. Add emphasis, text, or arrows to help contextualize your screenshots. The editor can be accessed after taking a screenshot or by selecting *Open image from file* from the Greenshot menu. Inside the editor, annotation tools are organized along the left side of the interface.
