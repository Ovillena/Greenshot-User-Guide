The purpose of this document is to help you get started with using Linux by introducing you to some of its basic commands. Linux is a free operating system that is secure, customizable, and stable. These factors lead to the wide adoption of Linux and it now forms the backbone of the internet.

## Is This Guide for You
This guide was created for beginner Linux users who has some basic computer knowledge.

There are many comprehensive Linux documents out there, but those can be overwhelming. This guide was meant to provide a simpler way by teaching you only the basic Linux concepts and commands. By the end of this guide, you will have learned how to:

* install and run Linux on a virtual machine, (TODO section or del)
* create and modify user accounts,
* show and close processes,
* use the command line, and
* understand and use standard output.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this document, you should have access to a computer. If you have Linux installed _locally_ or in a _virtual machine_, great. If not, as long as you have an internet access, browser based Bash terminals such as [Bellard's Linux emulator](https://bellard.org/jslinux/ "Browser Linux emulator") or [Copy.sh's Linux emulator](https://copy.sh/v86/ "Browser Linux emulator") is another way to practice using Linux without installing anything.

## Why learn Linux
At its core, Linux is a free software used to control all types of hardware. Linux is used everywhere and it is not going away. The internet is built on Linux, phones are running on linux, even your smart appliances are using on Linux. If you are planing to have a career with any type of technology, it is almost guaranteed that you will be interacting with Linux. With this in mind, familiarizing your self with Linux is beneficial.

## Works on all versions
The concepts and commands covered in this document will work with any _Linux distributions_. A _Linux distribution_ is a collection of software bundled with the _Linux Kernel_. These bundles contain a certain set of features and settings for a particular purpose. The basic building blocks remain the same so all distributions of LInux still retains its main characteristics.

## Brief History
Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds when he was 21. It started out as a _Kernel_, the lowest level of code _interfacing_ with hardware. In 1992, the _Linux Kernel_ was bundled together with _GNUs_ (GNUâ€™s Not Unix) software packages and published under the _GNU General Public Licence_. This made GNU/Linux a legally free, fully featured operating system.

## Conclusion
The idea of a free, stable, customizable, powerful, and secure operating system is just too good to overlook. Many users simply moved to Linux to remove themselves from propriety software, others out of curiosity. Anyone who works to the tech industry will also heavily use Linux. So if you wish to have a career in tech, start learning Linux.
