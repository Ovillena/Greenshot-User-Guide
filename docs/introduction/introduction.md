## Prerequisites

To follow along with this document, you will need the following:

**Note**: You can install Linux _locally_ or in a _virtual machine_. Alternatively, browser based terminals such as [Bellard's Linux emulator](https://bellard.org/jslinux/ "Browser Linux emulator") or [Copy.sh's Linux emulator](https://copy.sh/v86/ "Browser Linux emulator") is another way to access Linux without installing anything.    

- access to a computer with a keyboard and mouse,

## Brief History
Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 at the age of 21. Linux started out as a _Kernel_, the lowest level of code _interfacing_ with hardware.

In 1992, the _Linux Kernel_ was bundled together with _GNUs_ (GNUâ€™s Not Unix) software packages and published under the _GNU General Public Licence_. This made GNU/Linux a legally free, fully featured operating system.

## Why learn Linux
Linux sees use everywhere and Linux is not going away any time soon. Linux is a free software used to control all types of hardware. Linux builds the internet, phones run on Linux, and even your smart appliances use Linux.

If you plan to have a career related to technology, you will interact with Linux at some point. With this in mind, we want you to familiarize your self with Linux as this can be beneficial.

## Works on all versions

The concepts and commands covered in this document will work with any _Linux distributions_. A _Linux distribution_ is a collection of software bundled with the _Linux Kernel_. These bundles contain a set of features and settings for a particular purpose.

The basic building blocks remains the same so all distributions of Linux still retains the main characteristics.

## Conclusion
The idea of a free, reliable, customizable, and secure operating system is too good to overlook. Many users switch to Linux to remove themselves from propriety software or just out of curiosity. Anyone who works in the tech industry also heavily rely on the use of Linux.

With that in mind, let's get started on teaching you some of the essentials. We recommend that you start with [navigating through the file system.](https://dl90.github.io/linux-basics/docs/navigating)
