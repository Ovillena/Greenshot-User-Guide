{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The purpose of this document is to help you get started with using Linux and basic commands. Linux provides users with a free operating system that is highly secure and stable, while still offering many features that other operating systems do.

### Is This Guide for You?
This guide is created for students or beginner users of Linux that have a basic technical background. There are many comprehensive Linux documents out there, but most of those documents can be overwhelming. This guide simplifies the learning process by teaching you only the basic Linux concepts and commands. By the end of this guide, you will have learned how to:
install and run Linux on a virtual machine,
create and modify user profiles,
show and end processes,
use the command line, and
understand and use standard output.

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this document, you should have access to a computer. Experience with using a computer is helpful. Internet access to online Bash terminals such as https://bellard.org/jslinux/ or https://copy.sh/v86/ is another way to practice using Linux.


### Why learn Linux?
At its core, Linux is a free software used to control all types of hardware. Linux is used everywhere and it is not going away. The internet is built on Linux, phones are running on linux, even your smart appliances are running on Linux. If you plan to be working with any type of technology, it is almost guaranteed that you will be interacting with Linux. With this in mind, familiarizing your self with Linux is beneficial.

### Works on all versions?
The concepts and commands covered in this document will work on any Linux distribution. A Linux distribution is a collection of software bundled with the Linux Kernel. These bundles  contain a certain set of features and settings for a particular purpose. The basic building blocks remain the same so any distribution of LInux still retains its main characteristics.

### Brief History
Linux was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds when he was 21. It started out a Kernel, the lowest level of code interfacing with hardware. In 1992, the Linux Kernel was bundled together with GNUs (GNUâ€™s Not Unix) software packages and published under the GNU General Public Licence. This made GNU/Linux a legally free fully featured operating system.

### Conclusion
The idea of a free, stable, customizable and secure operating system is just too good to overlook. With the number of growing Linux users...
