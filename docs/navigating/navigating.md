# Navigating the File System

---

## Introduction

Navigating through a computer system without a _GUI_ (graphical user interface) can seem daunting. The good news is, most if not all modern distributions of Linux includes a GUI. Some of these may even offer a better experience than Windows or Mac, but we will not go there today.

The goal of this section is to explain and show you that navigating Linux through the _CLI_ (command-line interface) is not difficult. With enough practice, you may find that using the _CLI_ to navigate through a computer is sometimes easier and even quicker.

Using the CLI also introduces additional functionalities that may have been overlooked in a _GUI_. To use the Linux _CLI_, we will be using an application called _terminal_.
