## Navigating the File System

---

### Introduction

Navigating through a computer system without a _GUI_ (graphical user interface) can seem daunting. The good news is, most if not all modern distributions of Linux include a GUI. Some of these may even offer a better experience than Windows or Mac, but we will not go there today.

The goal of this section is to explain and show you that navigating Linux through the CLI (command-line interface) is not difficult and all of its hidden functionalities. With enough practice, you may even find that using the CLI to navigate the computer is easier and quicker.
